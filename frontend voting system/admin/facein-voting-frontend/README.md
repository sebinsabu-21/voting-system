# FaceIn Voting Frontend

A minimal Next.js application for role selection in the FaceIn Voting System.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the home page.

## Project Structure

- `/pages/index.jsx` - Minimal home page with Admin/Voter role selection
- `/pages/admin/index.jsx` - Admin area placeholder
- `/pages/voter/index.jsx` - Voter area placeholder

## Notes

The home page is intentionally minimal and only includes role selection. All detailed features will be added to the `/admin` and `/voter` pages later.
